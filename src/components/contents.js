    Hi! I'm Jeongwon, a junior developer seeking for the job opportunity based in Seoul, South Korea. <br /><br />I enjoy consuming almost all kinds of media contents, but love to think of human experience and technology behind them more. <br /><br />I hope I can act as a bridge between them with my skill and insight.
